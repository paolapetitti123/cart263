# Artist Statement


Recently I was binge watching some of my favourite Disney movies from when I was growing up and while watching Flubber I had gotten the idea for this project based off of one scene from the movie where Philip (played by Robin Williams) creates Flubber in his basement and it starts bouncing all around the house breaking whatever it could until Philip catches it with a baseball glove. I wanted to try and recreate that scene as best as I could so I got 2 backgrounds off of shutter stock (links to everything I used are in the comments of my code) of a basement, one was clean and the other had broken pipes and flooding. The flooded basement is used when the timer runs out and you haven’t caught flubber, however if you catch flubber the basement is fine. The best way I could think of to get the user to catch flubber was to use Handpose from ml5.js, similar to the bubble popper activity/exercise we had. However instead of using the whole finger,  I decided to use only the tip of the index finger since it would make more sense to put the baseball glove image on one point. After I finished getting flubber to bounce off the borders and the user was able to catch flubber, I decided to add web-storage to the game as well to somewhat keep track of your score every time you play the game, at the end if you win it’ll tell you how much better or worse you did from your last run through the game. Another thing, since ml5.js & Handpose takes some time to load before the program starts, instead of adding a screen that just says loading ml5.js, I used that idea to instead show the users a screen that explain to the user how to play the game and once it’s done loading it automatically starts the game.
