# Artists Statement

I was watching some music videos on youtube and stumbled across this group called ATEEZ who have this entire elaborate storyline that stretches through all their music videos they've released so far in the years that they've been a group and the theme surrounding this storyline is like modern day pirates. So this had really inspired me to make this game, the boat you see in the game is inspired by the pirate ship they have in their music videos however I did alter a bit to better fit the game. While you're playing the game I hope it's enjoyable/stress free, I tried to make the game easy to play as I did struggle quite with the coding aspect of a lot of the features of the game. It took me way too long to finally get the instance canvases working and I just kept having so many issues coming up with the. However I will say I am very proud of how the game turned out, despite all the hair pulling, the challenge of mixing phaser 3 with jquery ui, learning how to use a neural network and make my own training data, as well as incorporating annyang and responsivevoice without having the game severally lag to the point where it's unplayable was very satisfying when I finally finished.
