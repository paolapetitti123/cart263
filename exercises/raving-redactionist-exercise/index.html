      <h2>Declaration of Independence: A Transcription</h2>
      <p>
        The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, <span class="top-secret redacted">it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to</span> assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, <span class="top-secret redacted">a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should</span> declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
      </p>

      <p>
        We hold these truths to be self-evident, <span class="top-secret redacted">that all men are created equal</span>, that they are <span class="top-secret redacted">endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights</span>, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these <span class="top-secret redacted">rights</span>, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their <span class="top-secret redacted">Safety and Happiness</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prudence, indeed, will dictate that <span class="top-secret redacted">Governments long established</span> should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that <span class="top-secret redacted">mankind</span> are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of <span class="top-secret redacted">abuses and usurpations</span>, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, <span class="top-secret redacted">to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.</span>
